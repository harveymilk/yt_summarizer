# YouTube Transcript → ChatGPT Summary in one click

## Install locally

1. **Clone / download** this repo, then open Chrome (or Brave) at  
   `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top-right toggle) → **Load unpacked** → select the folder.
3. The extension icon (<img src="favicon-32x32.png" width="18"/>) will appear in your toolbar.  
   Pin it if you want quick access.
4. The first time you click the icon Chrome will ask to “Allow this extension to debug the browser.”  
   Click **Allow** (needed so the extension can type into ChatGPT).

## Using it

1. Open any YouTube video (make sure it has a transcript).
2. Click the extension icon.  
   *That’s it:* a ChatGPT tab pops up, the formatted prompt appears, and the message is sent :)

Let me know if there's any issues, this was first extension I built to not waste time watching 20-minute videos that can easily be condensed into a few bullet points!
