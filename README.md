3. The extension icon (<img src="favicon-32x32.png" width="18"/>) will appear in your toolbar.  
   Pin it if you want quick access.

Let me know if there's any issues, this was first extension I built to not waste time watching 20-minute videos that can easily be condensed into a few bullet points!
